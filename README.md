## Overview of Analysis
### Background Context
Pewlett-Hackard is a large organzation with thousands of employees, many of them on the verge of retirement. Unfortunately, the company's employee data was spread across six different CSV files, all containing various information on the employees' departments, birth dates, hire dates, salaries, titles, etc. Using Postgres, I helped Bobby, an HR analyst at Pewlett-Hackard, create a list of employees who are elible for retirement. Included below is an image of this list.
